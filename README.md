# Hanwen's Front-end Nanodegree Arcade Game

A simple, easy-to-play game similar to Frogger.

* Use the arrow keys to move your player around the screen.
* The goal of the game is to reach the water at the top of the screen.
* You have 5 lives and one is lost each time you touch a bug.
* Touching a bug will also reset you to your starting position.
* For each successful round, you get 50 points and you can win additional points by collecting Gems.

There are 5 built-in characters that you can choose from at the beginning of a game. Use the left and right keys to do so and press Enter to play!
